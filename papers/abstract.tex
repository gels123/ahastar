\section{Abstract}
In this paper we present new techniques for the automated construction of state space representations of complex multi-terrain grid maps with minimal information loss. Our approach involves the use of graph annotations to record the amount of maximal traversable space at each location on a map. We couple this with a cluster-based hierarchical abstraction technique to build highly compact yet complete representations of the original problem. We further outline the design of a new planner, Annotated Hierarchical A* (AHA*), and demonstrate how a single abstract graph can be used to plan for many different agents, including different sizes and terrain traversal capabilities. 
Our experimental analysis shows that AHA* is able to generate near-optimal solutions to a wide range of problems while maintaining an exponential reduction in comparative effort over low-level search. 
Meanwhile, our abstraction technique is able to generate approximate representations of large problem-spaces with complex topographies using just a fraction of the storage space required by the original grid map.
