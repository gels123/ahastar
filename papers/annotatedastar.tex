\section{Annotated A*}
\label{aha:aastar}
Low-level planning for diverse sets of agents using clearance values is a straightforward application of the ideas thus far.
We use a variation on the A* algorithm \cite{astar} to compute an optimal shortest path between a start and goal node.  
Our approach differs from standard A* by requiring two additional parameters for each query: the agent's size and capability. This allows us to map any query into an instance of small-agent search as shown earlier by using the parameters to evaluate nodes before they are added to A*'s open list. We term the resultant algorithm Annotated A* (AA* for short).
